# 🍷 Kernel PCA with Logistic Regression - Wine Dataset

This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction using **Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA)** followed by classification using **Logistic Regression**. The dataset used is the classic **Wine dataset**, which contains chemical analysis results of wines derived from three different cultivars.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Wine.csv`, which contains:
- **13 numerical features** representing different chemical properties of wines.
- **Target column** indicating the class (cultivar) of wine (values: 1, 2, 3).

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for preprocessing, Kernel PCA, logistic regression, and evaluation
